Maven plugins for Geotk

  This directory contains Maven plugin created for the specific needs of the Geotoolkit.org project.
  Some of those plugins can be used for external projects, but creating general-purpose plugins is
  out of their scope.

  For more general build instructions, see the {{{../index.html}building Geotoolkit.org}} page.

  The main Maven plugins are:

  * {{{geotk-resource-compiler/index.html}Resources compiler}} for creating the binary files used for
    internationalization in Geotk.

  * {{{geotk-javadoc/index.html}Javadoc plugins}} for custom taglets.

  * {{{geotk-jar-collector/index.html}JAR collector}}, which can also create PACK200 files.
