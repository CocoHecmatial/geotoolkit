* Performing a Geotk release

  If the GeoAPI version number has changed, edit the version number declared
  in the <<<{{{update-version.xml}update-version.xml}}>>> file. Then define
  the Geotk version numbers and the deployment server:

-----------------------------------------------------
export OLD_VERSION="3.12"
export NEW_VERSION="3.13"
export GEOTK_SERVER=(... put foo@server.com here ...)
-----------------------------------------------------

  Then, run the script after making sure that the tests pass:

---------------------
cd public
mvn clean test
../release/release.sh
---------------------
