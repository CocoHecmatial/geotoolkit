# --- Description -----------
Description:\
Stresses read or write operations on coverages.


# --- Actions ---------------
coverages:\
Stresses read or write operations on coverages. This action expects exactly one argument, \
which shall be the filename of a serialized Java object to use as input.


# --- Options ---------------
outputFormat:\
If specified, write the request result in an image of the given format and read it back. \
The format name can optionally be concatenated with "(native)" or "(standard)" suffix \
for forcing explicitely the native (from JAI-Image I/O library) or standard codec.

outputCRS:\
The Coordinate Reference System in which to reproject the images.

minSize:\
The minimal size (in pixels) of random queries. \
The default value is 100 pixels.

maxSize:\
The maximal size (in pixels) of random queries. \
The default value is 2000 pixels.

maxScale:\
The maximal scale of random queries, relative to the source data. For example a value of 10 means \
that the request will ask for a resolution at most 10 time larger than the resolution of source data. \
The default is computed in such a way that the requested images at the largest resolution are not \
smaller than the minimal grid size.

numThreads:\
The number of threads to create for running the tests. \
The default value is the number of processors plus 1.

duration:\
The test duration, in seconds. \
The default value is 10 seconds.

randomSeed:\
If specified, the seed to use for random number generators. This should be set only when it is \
desirable to run the stressor many time with exactly the same requests. Different threads will \
still use different requests.

verbose:\
If specified, more information will be reported during the stress.

view:\
If specified, the results of request are shown as images in windows.
