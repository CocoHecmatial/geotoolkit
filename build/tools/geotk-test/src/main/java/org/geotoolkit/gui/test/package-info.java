/**
 * Tools for Geotk test suites on widgets. The base class provided in this package
 * manage a {@link javax.swing.JDesktopPane} with menu for a few actions like taking
 * a screenshot of the active internal frame.
 * <p>
 * By default the tests display nothing; it merely checks that no exception is thrown during
 * widget construction. However if the "{@code org.geotoolkit.showWidgetTests}" system property
 * is set to "{@code true}", then the widgets will be shown as an internal frame in the desktop.
