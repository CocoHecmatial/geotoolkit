 * ({@linkplain #getTimeRange time range}, {@linkplain #getGeographicBoundingBox geographic
 * bounding box}, <cite>etc.</cite>) without the need to open the image file, since the metadata
 * are extracted from the database. The actual loading of pixel values occurs when
 * {@link #getCoverage(IIOListeners)} is invoked for the first time.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage example:</b>
 * {@preformat java
 *     CoverageDatabase db       = new CoverageDatabase(...);
 *     Layer            layer    = db.getLayer("My Layer").result();
 *     CoverageEnvelope envelope = layer.getEnvelope(null, null);
 *     envelope.setHorizontalRange(...);
 *     envelope.setVerticalRange(...);
 *     envelope.setTimeRange(...);
 *     GridCoverageReference ref = layer.getCoverageReference(envelope);
 *     GridCoverage2D coverage = ref.getCoverage(null);
 * }
