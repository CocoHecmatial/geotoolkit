/**
 * Base class of {@link GridCoverage} writers. Writing is a two steps process:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The output must be set first using the {@link #setOutput(Object)} method.</li>
 *   <li>The actual writing is performed by a call to the
 *       {@link #write(GridCoverage, GridCoverageWriteParam)} method.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     GridCoverage coverage = ...
 *     GridCoverageWriter writer = ...
 *     writer.setOutput(new File("MyCoverage.asc"));
 *     writer.write(coverage, null);
 * }
 *
 * {@note This class is conceptually equivalent to the <code>ImageWriter</code> class provided
 * in the standard Java library. Implementations of this class are often wrappers around a Java
 * <code>ImageWriter</code>, converting geodetic coordinates to pixel coordinates before to
 * delegate the writing of pixel values.}
