/**
 * Interface for {@link ImageReader} and {@link ImageWriter} implementations that may store
 * a large dataset as an aggregation of smaller datasets. There is many different way in which
 * an aggregation may be used:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A <var>n</var> dimensional coverage (the aggregation) may be defined as a list of
 *       <var>n</var>-1 dimensional slices (the aggregated files).</li>
 *   <li>A long time series (the aggregation) may be separated in a sequence of smaller
 *       time series (the aggregated files). In this use case, the aggregation and the
 *       aggregated files have the same number of dimension.</li>
 *   <li>The bands (or <cite>variables</cite> in NetCDF files) may be defined in separated
 *       files.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The main practical case for this interface is NcML files, which are XML files enumerating
 * the NetCDF files that are the elements of the aggregation.
