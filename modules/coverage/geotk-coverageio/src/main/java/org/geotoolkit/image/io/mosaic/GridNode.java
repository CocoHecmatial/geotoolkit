     * case" scenario. This method tries to attenuate the effect of worst case scenario.
     * <p>
     * The order of nodes is significant. This method must prepend bigger nodes first, like what
     * we would get if the nodes where associated with real tiles and the array sorted with the
     * {@link #PRE_PROCESSING} comparator.
     * <p>
     * The current algorithm requires that all tiles are organized on a regular grid. If the given
     * array does not meet this criterion, then we are better to not try to prepend anything (the
     * only consequence is slower execution). If we tried to use a better algorithm in this method,
     * we would be taking the path of a real RTree, which is the subject of many litterature and
     * out of scope of this mosaic package (which basically assumes a pre-existing layout suitable
     * for the mosaic needs).
     *
     * @param  nodes The nodes for which to prepend a tree.
     * @return The nodes with a tree prepend before them.
     *
     * @todo In its current form, this method is not quite useful since it does its job only in
     *       the cases where <code>GridTileManager</code> would have been used instead than the
     *       <code>TreeTileManager</code>.  It still useful for assertions since this method is
     *       used in the context of <code>ComparedTileManager</code>.
     *       <p>
     *       This method could be made more useful by extending its scope beyond the cases handled
     *       by <code>GridTileManager</code>.  We could accept larger tiles having a size which is
     *       a multiple of "normal" tiles.
