# Test file for World File parsing.
#
# The values below do not provide an accurate localization of the matrix.txt file.
# We are interrested only in testing the WorldFileReader capability to store those

# Note that the extension of this matrix.tfw file could have been 'ttw' according
# World File rules. The WorldFileReader should accept both.
