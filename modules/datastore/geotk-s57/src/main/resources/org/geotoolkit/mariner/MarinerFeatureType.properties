8194.cursor=Cursor;A 'cursor' is used as a pointer for various purposes, e.g. establishing a waypoint  obtaining further information about a feature that the cursor is pointing at, such as a light  reading geographical coordinates  for bearing and distance measurements  and so on.

8198.leglin=Leg;A 'leg' is a line which connects two waypoints. A series of waypoints and legs makes up a route.;The attribute \u201cselect\u201d should be used to distinguish planned and alternate routes and their legs.The attribute \u201clegchr\u201d should be used to distinguish great circle routes.Course and distance of a legline are calculated from the geometric primitive and therefore need no attribute.The colour for the selected planned route is PLRTE.  For the alternate planned route it is APLRT. As required by the mariner, the ECDIS voyage planning system should:(a.) Annotate each leg with planned course (always 3 digits) and speed to make good.

A "danger highlight" shall solely be used to define an existing chart feature believed to be dangerous. The mariners' feature is used by the mariner also for observation report purposes. Whilst a \u201cmariners' note\u201d consists of text written on the display, the \u201cmariners' feature\u201d may consist of symbols, lines or areas drawn interactively by the mariner, as he does on the paper chart. The colour allocated to mariners' features is NINFO. point feature:	an exclamation mark in a circle or a small letter "I" in a box or any chart symbol in orange. line feature:	solid or dashed line, NINFO,   1 or 2 pixels wide. area feature:	if a filled area is required,  use area fill, , 75% transparency,  ADINF {AC(ADINF,3)}.Chart features drawn by the mariner should be distinguished as described in Part1 Section 8.7 of this document.;To meet the requirement of IMO PS 1.6, and of IHO S-52 sections 1.1 and 5.5;OBJNAM;SCAMIN/usrmrk;inptid/RECDAT/loctim;Area; Line; Point;

The conning position and the position of the navigation system antenna will seldom coincide.;Distinction: 'vessel'. The ship's position must first be adjusted for the offset between the navigating antenna and the conning position. Two symbols are available for own ship, at mariners' option:(a.)	Two concentric circles. (b.)	A symbol representative of the own ship's outline, drawn to indicate the length and breadth (beam) of the ship at the scale of the ECDIS display.This scaled symbol should only be used if the scaled ship's length is not less than 6\u00a0mm.In drawing the outline of the ship, the offset of the conning position from the artificial pivot point in the centre of the scaled ship symbol must be taken into account.  Both these symbols include the optional heading and beam bearing lines..The symbolization of own ship is ruled by a conditional symbology procedure which also applies the course & speed  vector  and selects the own ship symbol or the scaled ship symbol depending on the mariner's selection, so long as the scaled symbol is at least 6 mm long.;IEC 61174 Annex E Section 1;cogcrs/headng/sogspd/shpbrd/shplen/ctwcrs/stwspd/vecper/vecmrk/vecstb;;;Point;

The attributes above should be the only ones with values that have to be defined by the mariner. The attribute select is used to distinguish planned and alternate waypoints.Waypoints have spatial relations to leg lines so that they may define the beginnings or ends of legs.Waypoints may be labeled. The label must be unique. The first character must be a letter, but not "o", "I" or "z".
