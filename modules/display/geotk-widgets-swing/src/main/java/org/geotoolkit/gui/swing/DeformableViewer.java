 * viewer is capable to show a {@linkplain ZoomPane#setMagnifierVisible magnifying glass} on top of
 * the usual content. The presence of a magnifying glass deforms the viewer in that the apparent
 * position of pixels within the glass are moved. This interface allows for corrections of apparent
 * pixel position in order to get the position we would have if no deformations existed.
