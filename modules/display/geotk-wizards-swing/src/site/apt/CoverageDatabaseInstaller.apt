Installing the Coverage-SQL database

* Installing and launching the wizard

  Download the latest version of <<<geotk-bundle.pack.gz>>> from {{{http://download.geotoolkit.org}http://download.geotoolkit.org}}.
  Open a command-line window and set the current directory to the directory where the Geotk bundle has
  been saved. Uncompress the file using the command below (replace <<<SNAPSHOT>>> by the actual version
  number), then execute:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
unpack200 --remove-pack-file geotk-bundle-SNAPSHOT.pack.gz geotk.jar
java -jar geotk.jar
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  A window will appear with a menu. Select "<Wizards>", "<New coverage database>".

* Prerequites

  Before to go through the wizard, the user shall perform the following steps:

  * Ensure that a PostgreSQL server with PostGIS extension is running.

  * Ensure that the directory which contain the PostGIS <<<lwpostgis.sql>>> and
    <<<spatial_ref_sys.sql>>> files is accessible from the computer running the
    wizard (a read-only access is sufficient), or copy those files in a local
    directory.

  * Create an initially empty PostgreSQL database, preferably with Unicode encoding.
    Do <<not>> create language and do not create the PostGIS objects in that database.
    This will be performed by the wizard.
