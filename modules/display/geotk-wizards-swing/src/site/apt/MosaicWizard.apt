Creating an image mosaic

* Installing and launching the wizard

  Download the latest version of <<<geotk-bundle.pack.gz>>> from {{{http://download.geotoolkit.org}http://download.geotoolkit.org}}.
  Open a command-line window and set the current directory to the directory where the Geotk bundle has
  been saved. Uncompress the file using the command below (replace <<<3.x-SNAPSHOT>>> by the actual
  version number):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
unpack200 --remove-pack-file geotk-bundle-3.x-SNAPSHOT.pack.gz geotk.jar
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Execute with a large amount of memory (1 gigabyte in the example below). The wizard can works with
  much less memory, but more memory makes it faster because it allows the wizard to reduce the amount
  of read passes.

--------------------------
java -Xmx1G -jar geotk.jar
--------------------------

  A window will appear with a menu. Select "<Wizards>", "<Mosaic generator>". Note that the
  "<File>", "<Preferences>" option can be safely ignored because the mosaic generator doesn't
  need this setup.


* Select source tiles

  The first wizard window should looks like the screenshot below:

[screenshots/SelectInputTiles.png]

  Press the "<Add>" button. An Open dialog box will appear for choosing the input files. The
  images format (PNG, TIFF, <etc.>) must be selected. Each image file <<must>> be completed by
  a {{{http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_file}World File}} having the <<<.tfw>>>, <<<.pgw>>>
  or <<<.jgw>>> extension, depending on the image format.

  As an alternative to the direct selection of image files, it is possible to select instead a
  text file which contains a list of image files. This is useful if the files to select are
  spread in many directories, or if a frozen subset of images is to be used. Click on the
  "<Format>" button and select "<List of images>", then select the "<<<.txt>>>" or "<<<.csv>>>"
  file as in the screenshot below:

[screenshots/OpenDialog.png]

  Press the "<Open>" button for starting the loading of tiles information. The wizard will read
  the image headers and the <World Files>, which may take a few minutes if there is thousands of
  tiles (this operation can be cancelled at any time). Once completed, the list of tiles appears
  in a table on the left side, and a visual representation appears on the right side:

[screenshots/ViewInputTiles.png]

  The "<File>" column in the table contains the selected file names. The "<Width>" and "<Height>"
  columns give the dimension of every tiles. The "<x>" and "<y>" columns give the position in pixel
  coordinates of each tiles in the input mosaic, with the origin (0,0) in the upper-left corner.
  The "<sx>" and "<sy>" columns give the pixel sizes relative to the tiles having the finest pixels.
  Those 4 last columns are computed from the information found in the <World Files>. Note that the
  input mosaic can be rotated - the above computation is robust to rotations, provided that every
  tiles have the same rotation angle.

  An arbitrary amount of lines in the table can be selected. This selection is shown in the picture
  on the right pane as darker tiles. The selected tiles can be removed from the list of input tiles
  by pressing the "<Remove>" button. Other tiles can be added by pressing again the "<Add>" button.
  This process can be repeated for example in order to add tiles in different directories.

  If the input mosaic is very large, it may be useful to zoom and navigate in the picture on the right
  pane. A right-click on the picture provides a contextual menu for this purpose. The mouse whell can
  also be used for zooming in and out.

  When the list of input tiles is complete, click on "<Next>"


* Define the tiling and pyramid levels

  The next wizard step suggests an output tiles size and subsampling for the various pyramid levels
  to write. The subsampling is relative to the input tiles having the finest pixels, i.e. the ones
  having the value (1,1) for the (<sx>,<sy>) columns in the previous wizard step. The graph on the
  right side gives an estimation of the theorical performance when reading tiles at the subsamplings
  on the abscissa. The 100% value is the best performance one could expect.

  The output tiles size and subsamplings are computed by default in a way that try to produce an
  integer number of output tiles (i.e. the tiles on the last row and last column are complete).
  However those values can be freely modified. An output tile size close to 256 gives good
  performance at the cost of a greater amount of tiles.

  <<In current implementation, experience shows that the default proposal of subsamplings is sub-optimal>>.
  Experience suggests that it is better to define the subsampling as powers of 2, like in the screenshot
  below. We have not yet identified why other subsampling values seem to hurt performance (they should
  be neutral at worst). In the maintime, users are encouraged to remove all default subsampling
  values by pressing the "<Remove>" button, then add new values in the "<X axis>" column and pressing
  "<Enter>" on the keyboard.

  The output directory and the output format shall also be specified in this step. When all
  information are accurate, press "<Next>".


* Remove opaque border

  Some input tiles may have an opaque border (typically black or white). If the output mosaic is
  to be overlayed with other images, it is preferable to replace opaque border by a transparent
  one. An arbitrary amount of border colors to make transparent can be specified at this step.
  If at least one color is specified, then the wizard will apply the following algorithm:

  * For each input tile:

    * For each corner in the input tile:

      * Replace every consecutive occurrence of a specified opaque color by a transparent color.

      * Stop the search at the first pixel which was not specified in the list of opaque colors to replace.\
        This prevent the algorithm to replace opaque colors that may appear in the middle of the tile.

    * Cache the result in a temporary file. This will require an amount of free disk space at least
      equal to the space used by the input tiles.

  []

  To add an opaque color to make transparent, select the color in the right pane and press the
  "<Add>" button. Repeat this operation for each color to make transparent.

[screenshots/SuppressOpaqueBorder.png]

  When all opaque colors (if any) have been selected, press "<Next>".


* Confirm

  The last step just waits for confirmation. Press the "<Finish>" button for launching the
  creation of the output image mosaic. This operation may take many hours if there is many
  thousands of input tiles. When the operation is finished, the wizard will disappear if
  they were no error. In case of error, the wizard will stay open with an error message.


* The result

  The output directory will contain every output tiles with a name pattern like
  <<<L\{level\}_\{column\}\{row\}.\{extension\}>>> where <<<\{level\}>>> is the pyramid level as
  a decimal number (<<<01>>> for the level having the finest pixels, <<<02>>> for the next level
  defined in the wizard, <etc.>), <<<\{column\}>>> is the column of the tile (<<<AA>>> for the
  first column, <<<AB>>> for the second column, <etc.>) and <<<\{row\}>>> is the row of the tile
  (<<<01>>>, <<<02>>>, <etc.>). For example the output tile in the upper-left corner will have a
  name similar to <<<L01_AA01.png>>>. The actual number of digits used may vary.

  Note that some tiles may be missing from the output directory, since the wizard omits the
  tiles having only transparent pixels.

  For every output tile, a <World File> having the same name with the appropriate extension will
  be created. This allow the exploitation of those tiles in other softwares. It can also be used
  as a slower but more portable way to recreate the mosaic for use in Geotk. The faster but
  geotk-specific way is described below.

  In addition, the output directory will contain a <<<TileManager.serialized>>> file which is an
  instance of the <<<TileManager>>> class that client code can deserialize as below:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("TileManager.serialized"));
TileManager mosaic = (TileManager) in.readObject();
in.close();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This <<<TileManager>>> can be given in argument to the <<<MosaicImageReader.setInput(Object)>>>
  method for exploiting the mosaic just created.
