/**
 * Try to slice a given N-D grid envelope. The aim is to provide an iterator
 * which makes flat subset of an envelope on desired axes.
 *
 * By default, the iterator moves from the lower coordinates to the upper one.
 * For axes declared unmovables, the iterator returns the same boundary as input
 * envelope.
 *
 * For example, if you've got a 3D grid, and you want to move along its third
 * axis, you can build an iterator like that :
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Your 3D envelope
 * final GridEnvelope grid3D = new GeneralGridEnvelope({0, 0, 0}, {2, 2, 2} true);
 * // This is an important structure. Each value represents the value to step by
 * // for each dimension on each move. Here, we specify that we want to move
 * // only on the third dimension, from lower to upper corner, with a step of 1
 * final int[] increments = {0, 0, 1};
 * final GridIterator iterator = new GridIterator(grid3D, increments);
 * iterator.next(); // lower={0, 0, 0}; upper={2, 2, 0}
 * iterator.next(); // lower={0, 0, 1}; upper={2, 2, 1}
 * iterator.next(); // lower={0, 0, 2}; upper={2, 2, 2}
 * assert !iterator.hasNext();
 * ...
 * }
 * </pre>
