/**
 * Checks the existence of identifiers (usually primary keys) in a set of tables.
 * This class implements a very naive algorithm and is used only when some raisonably
 * meanful ID are wanted. If "meanful" ID is not a requirement, then it is much more
 * efficient to relies on the ID numbers generated automatically by the database.
 * <p>
 * This class checks if a given identifiers exists in the database. If it exists, then
 * it searchs for an unused {@code "id-n"} identifier, where {@code "id"} is the given
 * identifier and {@code "n"} is a number. The algorithm in this class takes advantage
 * of the fact that alphabetical order is not the same than numerical order for finding
 * an empty slot without scaning every records. However the selected numbers are not
 * garanteed to be in increasing order if there is "holes" in the sequence (i.e. if some
 * old records have been deleted). Generating strictly increasing sequence is not a goal
 * of this class, since it would be too costly.
 *
 * {@section Assumptions}
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code SELECT DISTINCT ID FROM "Table" WHERE ID LIKE 'proposal%' ORDER BY ID;} is
 *       assumed efficient. For example in the case of a PostgreSQL database, it requires
 *       PostgreSQL 8.0 or above with a {@code btree} index and C locale.</li>
 *   <li>The ordering of the {@code '-'} and {@code '0'} to {@code '9'} characters compared
 *       to other characters is the same than ASCII. This condition needs to hold only for
 *       those particular characters (the ordering between letters don't matter).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <K> The type of keys in the pool of prepared statements.
 * @param <V> The type of values in the pool of prepared statements.
