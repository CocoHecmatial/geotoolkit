/**
 * A pool of prepared statements with a maximal capacity. Oldest statements are automatically
 * closed and removed from the map when the number of statements exceed the maximal capacity.
 * Inactive statements are also closed after some timeout.
 *
 * {@section Synchronization}
 * Every access to this pool <strong>must</strong> be synchronized on {@code this}.
 * Synchronization is user-responsability; this class is not thread safe alone. It
 * will be verified if assertions are enabled.
 * <p>
 * Synchronization must be provided by the user because we typically need synchronized block
 * wider than the {@code get} and {@code put}Â scope. Execution of a prepared statement may
 * also need to be done inside the synchronized block, because a single JDBC connection can
 * not be assumed thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Example of usage:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     StatementPool<String,StatementEntry> pool = ...;
 *     String key = ...;
 *     synchronized (pool) {
 *         // Get an entry, or create a new one if no entry is available.
 *         // Note that we remove the entry from the map for preventing
 *         // 'removeEldestEntry' to close it before we are done.
 *         StatementEntry entry = pool.remove(key);
 *         if (entry == null) {
 *             entry = new StatementEntry(someStatement);
 *         }
 *         // Use the statement and give it back to the pool once we are
 *         // done. We do not put it back in case of SQLException.
 *         entry.statement.doSomeStuff();
 *         if (pool.put(key, entry) != null) {
 *             throw new AssertionError();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * @param <K> The type of keys.
 * @param <V> The type of values.
