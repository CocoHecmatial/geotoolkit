/**
 * Root package for various metadata implementations. This root package is not
 * linked to any particular metadata standard. It assumes that a standard is
 * defined through a set of Java interfaces (for example {@link org.opengis.metadata})
 * and uses reflection for performing basic operations like comparisons and copies.
 * <p>
 * Possible metadata implementations (already available or planed in a future Geotk version) are:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI><P>{@link org.geotoolkit.metadata.iso}: concrete implementation of ISO
 *       interfaces, including ISO&nbsp;19115 and ISO&nbsp;19115-2.</P></LI>
 *   <LI><P>{@code org.geotoolkit.metadata.dublin}: concrete implementation of
 *       Dublin core interfaces. <EM>Not yet implemented.</EM></P></LI>
 *   <LI><P>{@link org.geotoolkit.metadata.sql}: implementation of metadata interfaces
 *       backed by a SQL database. The metadata interfaces doesn't need to be ISO ones,
 *       which is why this package is not a sub-package of the ISO's one.</P></LI>
 * </UL>
