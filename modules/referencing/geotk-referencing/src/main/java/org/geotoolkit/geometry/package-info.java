/**
 * Basic geometric objects. The {@link org.geotoolkit.geometry.GeneralDirectPosition} class represents
 * a point in a multi-dimensional space. This space may have an arbitrary number of dimensions. For
 * a two-dimensional space, {@code DirectPosition} is conceptually equivalent to
 * {@link java.awt.geom.Point2D}.
 * <p>
 * The class {@link org.geotoolkit.geometry.GeneralEnvelope} represents a box in a multi-dimensional
 * space. For a two-dimensional space, {@code Envelope} is conceptually equivalent to
 * {@link java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D}.
