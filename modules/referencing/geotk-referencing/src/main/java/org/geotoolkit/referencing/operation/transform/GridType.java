/**
 * Whatever the grid values backing a {@link GridTransform} are directly the target coordinates
 * or offsets to apply on the source coordinates. If grid values are offsets, they may be added
 * directly to the source coordinates ({@link #OFFSET}) or they may be pre-multiplied by some
 * factor before to be added to source coordinates ({@link #NADCON}).
 *
 * {@note The special offset case (<code>NADCON</code>) is not strictly necessary since it
 *        would be possible to pre-multiply the scale factor straight in the grid. However
 *        the approach taken by <code>GridTransform</code> is to keep major formats unchanged.
 *        This approach allows for example a <code>RenderedImage</code> to share the same
 *        <code>DataBuffer</code> than the one used by <code>GridTransform</code>, and compare
 *        the visual aspect with publications.}
