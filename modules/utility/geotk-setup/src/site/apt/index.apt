Geotoolkit.org installer

  Most of the Geotoolkit library can work out of the box without any installation or setup.
  However they are some exceptions to this general rule. Some coordinate operations require a
  large amount of data, and not all those data are distributed with Geotk. For example the
  {{{http://www.epsg.org}EPSG database}} is bundled in Geotoolkit because it is considered a
  fundamental piece of referencing service applicable to many Coordinate Reference Systems in use
  around the world. On the other hand, {{{http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Nadcon/Nadcon.html}NADCON}}
  grids are large (about 2 Mb, including approximatively 1 Mb for Alaska alone) while applicable to
  only one country.

  Optional data like NADCON need to be saved in some specific directory. By default Geotoolkit searchs
  the data in the "<<<~/.geotoolkit>>>" directory, where "<<<~>>>" is the user home directory. However
  this directory can be modified at user convenience through a graphical user interface provided by
  this module. To launch the application, run the following from the command line:

java -jar geotk-setup.jar
