/**
 * Workaround for the missing {@code javax.swing.tree.TreeNode.getUserObject()}
 * method. Sun seems to have forgotten this method in the first <cite>Swing</cite>
 * draft. Unfortunately, since {@link javax.swing.tree.TreeNode} is an interface,
 * Sun can't fix it without breaking compatibility. We have to fix it ourselves,
 * which is the main purpose of this package.
