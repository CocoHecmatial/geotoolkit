/**
 * Extensions to standard Java {@link java.io.Reader} and {@link java.io.Writer} for I/O operations.
 * Contains also a few {@link java.text.Format} implementations that are expected to be used in
 * close relationship with readers or writers.
 * <p>
 * Many {@code Writers} defined in this package are actually {@link java.io.FilterWriter}
 * used for applying on-the-fly formatting while writing text to the output device. For
 * example {@link org.geotoolkit.io.IndentedLineWriter} adds intendation at the beginning
 * of every new line, and {@link org.geotoolkit.io.TableWriter} replaces all occurrence of
 * {@code '\t'} by the amount of spaces needed for producing a tabular output.
