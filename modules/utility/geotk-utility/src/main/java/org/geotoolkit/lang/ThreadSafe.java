/**
 * Annotates implementation classes that are thread safe. This annotation is
 * for documentation purpose only, and is applied only on classes that are worthly to note.
 * For example unless stated otherwise, thread-safety is implicit for {@linkplain Static static}
 * methods, {@linkplain Enum enumerations} and {@linkplain Immutable immutable} objects.
 * As a general rule:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><p>Classes without {@code @ThreadSafe} annotation may or may not be thread safe.
 *       Thread-safety may be implicit (as documented above), or the multi-thread behavior
 *       may be documented in the class javadoc, or not documented at all (typically because
 *       subject to changes). Unless otherwise known, class without annotation should be
 *       considered <strong>not</strong> thread-safe.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p>Classes with {@code @ThreadSafe} annotation are guaranteed to be thread safe.
 *       This guarantee is expected to apply to all subclasses as well. The later may be
 *       annotated explicitly for clarity, but don't have too.</p></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The sole purpose of this annotation is to replace the "<cite>This class is thread-safe</cite>"
 * sentence that would be otherwise copied in class javadoc.
