/**
 * A marker annotation for implementation classes that are thread safe. This annotation is
 * for documentation purpose only, and is applied only on classes that are worthly to note.
 * For example unless stated otherwise, thread-safety is implicit for most static methods,
 * enumerations and immutable objects. As a general rule:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><p>Classes without {@code @ThreadSafe} annotation may or may not be thread safe.
 *       Thread-safety may be implicit (static methods, enumerations, immutable classes,
 *       <cite>etc.</cite>, or the multi-thread behavior may be documented in the class
 *       javadoc, or not documented at all (typically because subject to changes).</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p>Classes with {@code @ThreadSafe} annotation are garanteed to be thread safe.
 *       This garantee is expected to apply to all subclasses as well. The later may be
 *       annotated explicitly for clarity, but don't have too. For example we don't
 *       annotate the ~100 metadata implementation classes.</p></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The sole purpose of this annotation is to replace the "<cite>This class is thread-safe</cite>"
 * sentence that would be otherwise copied in class javadoc.
