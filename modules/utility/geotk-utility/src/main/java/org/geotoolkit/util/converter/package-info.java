/**
 * Performs conversions between instances of different classes. For example it is sometime
 * convenient to consider {@link java.util.Date} objects as if they were {@link java.lang.Long}
 * objects for computational purpose in generic algorithms. This particular conversion is
 * straightforward when the type are known at compile-time, but more tedious when they must
 * be determined dynamically at run-time. This package allow that in a two-steps process:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Get a converter from {@link org.geotoolkit.util.converter.ConverterRegistry} from
 *       a given <var>source</var> to a given <var>target</var> class.</li>
 *   <li>Use the obtained {@link org.geotoolkit.util.converter.ObjectConverter} instance
 *       for performing the conversions.</li>
 * </ul>
