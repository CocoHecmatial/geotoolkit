    <h1>Maven Repository: Geotoolkit.org, GeoAPI and dependencies</h1>

    <p align="justify">This repository contains Java Archive (JAR) files of
    <a href="http://www.geotoolkit.org/">Geotoolkit.org</a> modules and its dependencies including
    <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/">GeoAPI</a>. The repository follows the standard layout of
    <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven&nbsp;2</a>, the project management tool used by
    Geotoolkit and other Java language projects. This repository adds to the
    <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">standard public Maven&nbsp;2 repository</a>. Users are
    welcome to rely on this repository for their own Maven&nbsp;2 builds.</p>

    <p align="justify">This repository contains modified <a href="http://www.geotools.org/">GeoTools</a> binaries
    in which some modules have been deleted and replaced by Maven dependencies to the Geotoolkit.org equivalent
    modules. They are provided as a convenience for those who want functionalities not yet ported to Geotoolkit.org,
    but without garanteed: some tests are known to fail. Those modified GeoTools modules and JAR file names are
    prefixed with "<code>gtm-</code>", to distinguish them from the official GeoTools distribution which prefix
    them with "<code>gt-</code>" and so should not conflict in any way.</p>

    <p align="justify">As an alternative to this Maven repository, users can download most of the
    Geotoolkit.org library (including its dependencies) as a single big JAR file. Those bundles
    are provided on the <a href="http://download.geotoolkit.org">download area</a>.</p>
