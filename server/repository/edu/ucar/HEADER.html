    <h1>NetCDF archives</h1>

    <p>This directory contains Java Archive (JAR) files for the
    <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/">NetCDF library</a>. The archives deployed
    in this directory are either legacy files used before the NetCDF build was "mavenized", or files
    modified before deployment (for example in order to replace some embedded dependencies by external
    dependencies).</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>NetCDF versions in the 2.<var>x</var> series were deployed on this repository or on the Geotools repository.
    Those artifacts were used by all Geotk versions prior to 3.18.
    NetCDF version 4.2.20 was deployed on the <a href="http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/edu/ucar/">Maven Central repository</a>.
    NetCDF version 4.3.10 and above are deployed on the <a href="http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/">UCAR repository</a>.
    Those changes in deployment target were accompanied by changes in Maven <code>groupId</code> and version policy,
    and consequently changes in the directory names listed in this repository:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Starting from 4.2.20, <code>bufrTables</code> has been renamed to <code>bufr</code>.</li>
      <li>Starting from 4.2.20, <code>unidatacommon</code> has been renamed to <code>unidataCommon</code> (with upper-case "C").</li>
      <li>Starting from 4.2.20, <code>grib</code> version numbers are aligned with <code>netcdf</code> version numbers.
          Consequently <code>grib</code> version 4.2.26 is more recent than <code>grib</code> version 8.0.27.</li>
      <li>Starting from 4.3.7, the <code>netcdf-parent</code> POM has been renamed <code>thredds-parent</code>.</li>
    </ul>
