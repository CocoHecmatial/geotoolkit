Geotoolkit.org guides

  The Geotk guides are a work in progress aiming to introduce the Geotk library to developers.
  The discussion will go from the international standards at the origin of many Geotk designs,
  through GeoAPI up to all modules provided in the core of Geotk.

  At this time, the guide is available only in French and cover only a few subjects.
  However we plan to complete this guide week after week, and to translate it to
  English when the French version will be about complete.
