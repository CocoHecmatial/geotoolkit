The Geotoolkit.org library

  Geotoolkit.org (abridged <Geotk>) is a free software, Java language library for developing
  geospatial applications. The library can be used for desktop or server applications.

  Geotk provides data structures for geographic data and associated metadata along with methods
  to manipulate those data structures. The library rests on a set of utility classes which include a
  framework for factory classes along with extensions to the Java language. The Geotk metadata
  module forms the base of the library and enables the creation of metadata objects which comply
  with the ISO\ 19115 metadata model and which can be read from or written to ISO\ 19139 compliant
  XML documents. The Geotk referencing module enables the construction of geodetic data
  structures for geospatial referencing based on the ISO\ 19111 model such as axis, projection and
  coordinate reference system definitions, along with the associated operations which enable the
  mathematical conversion of coordinates between different systems of reference. The Geotk
  coverage module extends the Java Advanced Imaging module to the geospatial realm by providing
  georeferencing wrappers to the JAI data model.

  The Geotk project plans to extend the library both by expanding the current modules and
  providing more modules for the library. The referencing module will be extended to handle new
  projections including grid based coordinate transformations. The coverage module will be extended
  by formalizing an API for image operations. A coverage-io module will be developed to provide a
  standard approach to the reading and writing of grid coverages which will be as applicable to
  simple imagery as to many dimensional data structures. The modules which are currently hosted in
  the separate, experimental repository <<<geotoolkit-pending>>> will be
  reviewed, refactored, and integrated into the core repository. These modules currently provide the
  experimental rendering module, the feature model from the GeoTools\ 2 project, and the symbology
  extension modules.


* News

  Latest Geotoolkit.org monthly release is Geotk-3.17, released March 11, 2011.
  This release depends on GeoAPI 2.3-RC1.

  The Geotk 3.17 release features improvements in ISO 19139 compliance, and bug fixes.


* License

  Geotk is free software, distributed to all under the license terms of the GNU Lesser
  General Public license version 2.1. See the {{{license.html}license}} page for details.



* Using Geotoolkit.org

  Geotk requires a Java 6 Runtime Environment. The JRE from Sun should be JRE 6 update 7 or
  newer. That is the only requirement for the base modules up to and including the Referencing
  module. To use the coverage module, Geotk also requires the Java Advanced Imaging\ (JAI)
  libraries available from Sun Microsystems. The module currently requires JAI version 1.1.3 or
  greater. The JAI libraries can be obtained from {{{https://jai.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html}the
  JAI website}}. When installed, the JAI download will place a JAR file and some native code into
  the Java Runtime Environment.

  The {{{download.html}download page}} explains in detail how to obtain pre-compiled binaries of
  Geotk either from the {{{http://maven.geotoolkit.org/}Maven\ 2 repository}} or from the
  {{{http://hudson.geomatys.com/job/Geotoolkit/}automated build page}}. The
  Maven\ 2 repository enables projects which use that built tool to declare a dependency on
  Geotk and have Maven automatically find and download the required binary archives. The
  automated build page provides bundles which group several Geotk modules into a single JAR
  file. The bundle <<<geotk-bundle-3.x-SNAPSHOT.pack.gz>>> contains a full set of Geotk modules
  providing the full functionality of the library. Other bundles are provided which contain
  different subsets of the project. A source bundle and a Javadoc bundle are also available.

  The {{{use.html}Introduction to Geotoolkit.org}} provides a brief explanation of how to create
  applications which use the library.


* Geotoolkit.org Source

  Geotk is hosted on its own mercurial source code repository,
  {{{http://hg.geotoolkit.org}http://hg.geotoolkit.org/}}. A complete copy of the repository can be
  'cloned' using the command:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hg clone http://hg.geotoolkit.org/geotoolkit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The mercurial clone will contain both the <repository> with the fully history (in the hidden
  <<<.hg/>>> directory) and the <working copy> comprised of all the code files visible in the root
  directory. The {{{http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/}Mercurial wiki}} explains how to use the
  tool for local version control and distributed collaboration.

  Geotk is built using the Maven\ 2 software project management tool using the command:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mvn install
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   which will find and download the dependencies and compile the source code. The first time this
   command is run, the user must be online in order to obtain all the required dependencies but
   subsequently the command can be run with the <<<--offline>>> parameter if there is no network
   connection. {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Maven}} provides a powerful build tool for the
   management of Java language projects.

   The {{{develop.html}Developing Geotoolkit.org}} page explains the basics of how to write code which
   is coherently integrated into the Geotk system.


* The Geotoolkit.org project

  The Geotk project has not yet formalized its system of
  collaboration nor decided on any particular style of project management. However, the project has
  been conceived to maximize the flexibility of all participants while ensuring the project can
  maintain high quality standards and evolve systematically with improvements in the Java language
  and with new technical visions of its contributors.

  The {{{project.html}Geotoolkit.org Project}} page provides more information on the Geotk project.


~~** History

  Geotk originated from several long term development projects. One original thread was the
  Seagis project of Martin Desruisseaux and another the GeoTools applet based project of James
  MacGill at the University of Leeds. Along the way, these two projects decided to fuse to create
  the GeoTools\ 2 project. Geotk started its independent existence as a fork from this
  GeoTools\ 2 project with the intent to clean the code base, remove duplicate functionality, reduce
  dependencies, fully document the javadoc API, and ensure that the code could be built daily.

  The {{{history.html}Geotoolkit.org History}} page provides a more complete history of the project.
