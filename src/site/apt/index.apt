The Geotoolkit.org library

  Geotoolkit.org (abridged <Geotk>) is a free software, Java language library for developing
  geospatial applications. The library can be used for desktop or server applications.
  Geotk is the reference implementation of {{{http://www.geoapi.org}GeoAPI 3.0}} interfaces.

  Geotk provides data structures for geographic data and associated metadata along with methods
  to manipulate those data structures. The library rests on a set of utility classes which include a
  framework for factory classes. The Geotk metadata
  module forms the base of the library and enables the creation of metadata objects which comply
  with the ISO\ 19115 metadata model and which can be read from or written to ISO\ 19139 compliant
  XML documents. The Geotk referencing module enables the construction of geodetic data
  structures for geospatial referencing based on the ISO\ 19111 model such as axis, projection and
  coordinate reference system definitions, along with the associated operations which enable the
  mathematical conversion of coordinates between different systems of reference. The Geotk
  coverage module applies the Java Advanced Imaging library to the geospatial realm by providing
  georeferencing wrappers to the JAI data model. The Geotk coverage I/O module provides a common
  approach to the reading and writing of grid coverages applicable to simple imagery as to many
  dimensional data structures.

  The Geotk project plans to extend the library both by expanding the current modules and
  providing more modules for the library. The referencing module will be extended to handle new
  projections. The coverage module will be extended by formalizing an API for image operations.
  The modules which are currently hosted in
  the separate, experimental repository <<<geotoolkit-pending>>> will be
  reviewed, refactored, and integrated into the core repository. These modules currently provide the
  experimental rendering module, the feature model from the GeoTools\ 2 project, and the symbology
  extension modules.


* GeoAPI 3.0 branch

  The Geotoolkit.org project maintains a branch of the {{{./modules/metadata/index.html}metadata}}
  and {{{./modules/referencing/index.html}referencing}} modules implementing the
  {{{http://www.geoapi.org/3.0/index.html}GeoAPI 3.0.0}} interfaces as published by OGC in their
  {{{http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geoapi}GeoAPI specification}}. This branch is deployed
  on the {{{http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|Geotoolkit}Maven Central repository}}. Maven
  projects can use this branch by appending <<<-geoapi-3.0>>> to the Geotk version number in
  their dependencies. See the {{{./branches.html}branches page}} for more information.


* Apache SIS and Geotk 3.<x>/4.<x> series

  Large part of Geotoolkit.org code is moving to the {{{http://builds.apache.org/job/sis-trunk/site/}Apache SIS}} project.
  This migration results in deprecation of massive amount of classes in the Geotk project,
  which will be replaced by the SIS equivalent. In many cases, migrating to SIS is just a
  matter of replacing the <<<org.geotoolkit>>> package name by <<<org.apache.sis>>> in the
  <<<import>>> declarations. However in some cases, the changes are more consistent.
  Non-trivial replacements are indicated in the comments of the <<<@deprecated>>> tags.

    * {{{./3.x/UpgradeTo4.xml}Ant script for automatic renaming of some package names}}.

  To reduce the annoyance, this replacement is performed only on the 4.<x> series of Geotk versions.
  The Geotk 3.<x> series still have no dependency to SIS, and their classes are not deprecated.
  However we expect that most future developments will happen in the Apache SIS project together
  with the Geotk 4.<x> series, and the Geotk 3.<x> series may receive only occasional bug fixes.

  Furthermore, the <<<geotoolkit>>> and <<<geotoolkit-pending>>> repositories will be merged in a
  single project in the 4.<x> series.


* Latest releases

  Latest Geotoolkit.org release is Geotk-4.0-M1, released July 2013.
  This release is a milestone toward migration to Apache SIS.

    * The <<<4.0-M0>>> release contains deprecated classes with links to their SIS replacement, mostly in the utility and metadata modules.

    * The <<<4.0-M1>>> release is very similar to the The <<<4.0-M0>>> one, with deprecated classes removed.

  See the {{{http://download.geotoolkit.org/4.0-M1/}download page}} for release notes.


* License

  Geotk is free software, distributed to all under the license terms of the GNU Lesser
  General Public license version 2.1. See the {{{./license.html}license}} page for details.



* Using Geotoolkit.org

  Geotk requires a Java 7 Runtime Environment.
  That is the only requirement for the base modules up to and including the Referencing
  module. To use the coverage module, Geotk also requires the Java Advanced Imaging\ (JAI)
  libraries available from Oracle. The module currently requires JAI version 1.1.3 or greater.
  The JAI libraries can be obtained from {{{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/current-142188.html}the Oracle website}}
  When installed, the JAI download will place a JAR file and some native code into the Java Runtime Environment.

  The {{{./download.html}download page}} explains in detail how to obtain pre-compiled binaries of
  Geotk either from the {{{http://maven.geotoolkit.org/}Maven\ 2 repository}} or from the
  {{{http://jenkins.geotoolkit.org/job/Geotoolkit/}automated build page}}. The
  Maven\ 2 repository enables projects which use that built tool to declare a dependency on
  Geotk and have Maven automatically find and download the required binary archives. The
  automated build page provides bundles which group several Geotk modules into a single JAR
  file. The bundle <<<geotk-bundle-4.x-SNAPSHOT.pack.gz>>> contains a full set of Geotk modules
  providing the full functionality of the library. Other bundles are provided which contain
  different subsets of the project. A source bundle and a Javadoc bundle are also available.

  The {{{./use.html}Introduction to Geotoolkit.org}} provides a brief explanation of how to create
  applications which use the library. The {{{./guides.html}developer guide}} (work in progress) will
  provide more detailed discussions.


* Geotoolkit.org Source

  Geotk is hosted on its own mercurial source code repository,
  {{{http://hg.geotoolkit.org}http://hg.geotoolkit.org/}}. A complete copy of the repository can be
  'cloned' using the command:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hg clone http://hg.geotoolkit.org/geotoolkit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The mercurial clone will contain both the <repository> with the fully history (in the hidden
  <<<.hg/>>> directory) and the <working copy> comprised of all the code files visible in the root
  directory. The {{{http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/}Mercurial wiki}} explains how to use the
  tool for local version control and distributed collaboration.

  Geotk is built using the Maven\ 2 software project management tool using the command:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mvn install
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   which will find and download the dependencies and compile the source code. The first time this
   command is run, the user must be online in order to obtain all the required dependencies but
   subsequently the command can be run with the <<<--offline>>> parameter if there is no network
   connection. {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Maven}} provides a powerful build tool for the
   management of Java language projects.

   The {{{./develop.html}Developing Geotoolkit.org}} page explains the basics of how to write code which
   is coherently integrated into the Geotk system.


* The Geotoolkit.org project

  The Geotk project has not yet formalized its system of
  collaboration nor decided on any particular style of project management. However, the project has
  been conceived to maximize the flexibility of all participants while ensuring the project can
  maintain high quality standards and evolve systematically with improvements in the Java language
  and with new technical visions of its contributors.

  The {{{./project.html}Geotoolkit.org Project}} page provides more information on the Geotk project.
