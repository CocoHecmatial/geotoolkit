Running Geotoolkit.org

  Geotk requires Java 6. No extension is required for the referencing and metadata
  modules. However if the coverage module is also used, then Geotk requires also the
  {{{https://jai.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html}Java Advanced Imaging}} library.
  Note that this library is pre-installed on MacOS X.


* EPSG database

  While not mandatory, the referencing module works better with a connection to an
  {{{http://www.epsg.org/}EPSG}} database. The database will be created automatically
  if the <<<geotk-epsg.jar>>> file is available on the classpath, together with
  <<one>> of the following dependencies:

    * <<<derby.jar>>>

    * <<<hdsldb.jar>>>

  By default, the database is created in a <<<Geotoolkit.org>>> sub-directory in the user
  application directory. This is always a sub-directory of the user home directory, but
  the complete path is platform-dependent ("<Application Data>" on Windows, "<Library>"
  on MacOS, the home directory on Linux). The directory can be changed by running the
  graphical application provided in the {{{modules/utility/geotk-setup/index.html}geotk-setup}}
  module.

  The above-cited Setup application can also create the EPSG database on PostgreSQL,
  using connection parameters which must be explicitly specified.
